## TimeCube.rs - The Ultimate Revelation of Time

Gene Ray's Time Cube theory asserts the existence of four simultaneous days in a single rotation of Earth.
TimeCube.rs embraces this revelation and provides a Rust API for exploring the four-sided time. Become a Knower of 4 
corner simultaneous 24-hour Days that occur within a single 4 corner rotation of Earth!

## Installation

Acknowledge
simple existing math proof
that 4 harmonic corner days
rotate simultaneously around
squared equator and cubed
Earth by adding TimeCube.rs as a dependency in your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
timecube = "0.1.0"
```

## WARNING

You have been educated stupid. Ignore 4 Corner Cube Math at your own **PERIL**, and of humanity.

## UTC: Universal Time Cube four-cornered truth

```rust
extern crate timecube;

use timecube::{TimeCube, TimePoint};

fn main() {
    // Embrace the TimeCube revelation
    let time_cube = TimeCube::new();

    // Experience the power of four-sided time
    let future = time_cube.now() + TimePoint::new(1, 0, 0, 0); // Embrace the future

    // Behold the truth
    println!("Now: {:?}", now);
    println!("Future: {:?}", future);
}
```
